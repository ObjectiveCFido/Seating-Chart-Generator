# Seating-Chart-Generator
JavaScript code which takes up to 24 names and who they prefer to sit by and randomly distributes them across 4 tables where each table has a maximum of 6 people. I would like some help improving the UI and the JS code.

Problems:

1. Form must be completely filled or it will not work

2. Table is very long, tedious to fill out (not sure if this will be easy to fix)

3. Often times someone is left alone at a table. This should not happen

Please open some pull requests so that I can get these issues resolves as soon as possible. Thank you!
